# <h1 align="center">ðŸ§  LogicNet - Subnet ðŸ¤–</h1>

## Introduction

### Description
LogicNet is a pioneering decentralized AI subnet focused on developing an open-source, high-performance model proficient in solving complex mathematical problems and conducting detailed data analysis. As the system evolves, it leverages incentivized feedback loopsâ€”miners are rewarded for improving model outputsâ€”ensuring continuous quality enhancement.

### Key Features

- ðŸš€ **Advanced Computational Network**:  
  Incentivizes miners (participants who submit solutions) to refine their answers, ensuring an ever-improving logical reasoning framework.

- ðŸ’° **Updated Incentive Mechanism**:
  - **Initial Score Calculation**:  
    Each response is assigned a preliminary score:
    ``` 
    score = (0.2 * similarity_score) 
            + (0.8 * correctness_score) 
            - (0.1 * time_penalty)
    ```
    - **Similarity Score**: Evaluated via cosine similarity between the miner's reasoning steps and the validator's ground-truth reasoning.
    - **Correctness Score**: Determined by an LLM comparing the minerâ€™s final answer to the expected solution.
    - **Time Penalty**: A small deduction for longer response times relative to a set timeout.

  - **Rank-Based Incentives**:  
    After scoring all responses:
    - Miners are ranked by their scores.
    - Rewards follow a cubic function based on rank:
      ``` 
      incentive_reward = [-1.038e-7 * (rank^3)] 
                         + [6.214e-5 * (rank^2)] 
                         - (0.0129 * rank) 
                         - 0.0118 + 1
      ```
    Higher-ranked miners earn disproportionately higher rewards, encouraging both precision and efficiency.

- ðŸŒŸ **Continuous Improvement**:  
  The system dynamically introduces more complex and diverse queries. Over time, model quality, dataset richness, and miner skill all steadily improve.
